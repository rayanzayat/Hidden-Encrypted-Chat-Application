# Hidden & Encrypted Chat Application â€“ Network Steganography in IPv4
This project demonstrates a hidden, encrypted chat application that uses network steganography to conceal communication within IPv4 packets. By leveraging the overflow field of the timestamp option, the system enables covert and secure data exchange without raising suspicion in normal network traffic.

# Key Features:
- Covert channel creation using IPv4 timestamp option (overflow field)
- End-to-end RSA encrypted chat communication
- Demonstrates the concept of hiding messages in legitimate network traffic
- Implementation of steganographic techniques in real network protocols
- Useful for research in cybersecurity, network security, and covert communication

# Technologies & Tools:
- Python
- Scapy
- Wireshark
- RSA
- Steganography
